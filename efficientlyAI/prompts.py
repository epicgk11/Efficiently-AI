1. **Task Fields Identification**:
   Analyze the user-provided request carefully and generate the following fields:
   - **Name**: Create a concise, meaningful title that summarizes the purpose of the task.
   - **Due Date**: Identify the final deadline for the task in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. If not explicitly mentioned, use today's date ({curr_date}) as a reference and distribute due dates for steps logically.
   - **Description**: Provide a clear, detailed explanation of the task, including its objectives, goals, and requirements.
   - **Tags**: Suggest relevant keywords or labels for categorizing the task, such as its domain, priority level, or type.
   - **Steps**: Break down the task into a list of smaller steps, each including:
       - A short, actionable name describing the step.
       - A logical due date relative to the overall deadline.
       - A default completion status set to `false`. Make sure to striclty set the same
   - **Resources**: Specify any tools, references, or materials required to complete the task. For resources which helps to complete a step add it with the step name. Seperate the resources with newline charater 

2. **Intelligent Suggestions**:
   - If the user does not provide a due date, logically estimate deadlines for each step. Today's date for reference : {curr_date}
   - If the user's request is vague or lacks details, propose a plausible task based on the context and guide them toward successful completion.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - Ensure all outputs are in a valid JSON format and adhere to the `Task` model schema.

4. **Example Task Model**:
   Below is an example of a structured task output you should follow:"""
